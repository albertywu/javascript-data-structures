# Data Structures & Applications (in Javascript)

This is my attempt at bridging the gap between data structures and applications in javascript. There are many repos out there that implement data structures, but I haven't seen many that explain how these data structures are useful in real-life problems.

Here you'll find:
* clean ES6 implementations of classic data structures

### [LinkedList](linkedList/LinkedList.js)
- [x] API: `addHead, removeHead, addTail, removeTail, isEmpty, first, last, reverse`
- [x] tests

---

### [Stack](stack/Stack.js)
- [x] API: `push, pop, peek, isEmpty, toString`
- [x] tests

---

### [Queue](queue/Queue.js)
- [x] API: `enqueue, dequeue, peek, isEmpty, toString`
- [x] tests

---

### Priority Queues / Binary Heap
- [ ] MaxPQ API: `insert, delMax, isEmpty, max, size, toString`
- [ ] MinPQ API: `insert, delMin, isEmpty, min, size, toString`
  
---

### BinarySearchTree
- [ ] API: `put, get, delete, keys, toString`
- [ ] Traversal: `inorder, preorder, postorder` traversal

---

### HashTable (w/Separate Chaining)
- [ ] API: `put, get, delete, contains, isEmpty, size, keys, toString`

---

### Undirected Graphs
- [ ] API: `addEdge, adj, vertices, edges, toString`

---

### Directed Graphs
- [ ] API: `addEdge, adj, vertices, edges, toString`
